# tsla lab
Exercise performed in GO language for demonstration purposes. The prject exercises the requirement's defined in an external document. This project will not reveal the requirements publically to protect the exercise criteria and the source of the exercise.

This project will however demonstrate a generic use of asynchronous go routines (agents) and a concurrent safe listener that is managed by a controller. The console will send commands to the controller to execute the control flow. 

## CLI options
------
<fill in here>

## Interactive console options
* Starting the agents 
* Stopping the agents, some or all
* List the current state of running agents and their types (good instrumentation candidate, think prometheus)

at anytime after the program starts, type "h" or "help" to get the commands menu

# Build Instructions
Instructions here assume you want the source code to evaluate, as well as run the program. 
Checkout the project from GitHub
```git clone github.com/dfense/gRPCtemplate```
Run the program
